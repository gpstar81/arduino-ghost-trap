# arduino-ghost-trap
Arduino microcontroller code for the operation of a 3D Printed Ghost Trap from the Ghostbusters films.

There are several versions of the code depending on which microcontrollers you are using.

Ghost_Trap v2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 are for use with a Arduino Uno controller with a Adafruit MusicMaker shield, several neopixels, switches and servos motors. 

Ghost_Trap Mega is designed around a Arduino Mega with a Adafruit MusicMaker shield several neopixels, switches and a 
separate controller for the servo motors.

Ghost_Trap Mega_tx is designed around a Arduino Mega with a Adafruit Musicmaker shield, the neopixels are driven separately by a Arduino Uno (mini or nanos)
and a separate controller for the servo motors. This requires the NeoPixels Metro to be uploaded to your Uno based microcontroller. 

Each code file has full clear instructions for setup and installation.
